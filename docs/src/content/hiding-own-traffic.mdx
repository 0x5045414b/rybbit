# Hiding Your Own Traffic

You can disable Rybbit tracking in your browser using the localStorage API.

<Steps>

### 1. Open your browser's developer console

Press **F12** or right-click the page and select "Inspect"

Navigate to the "Console" tab

### 2. Disable tracking

Enter this command to disable tracking:

```js
localStorage.setItem('disable-rybbit', 'true');
```

### 3. Re-enable tracking (when needed)

If you want to re-enable tracking later, enter:

```js
localStorage.removeItem('disable-rybbit');
```

</Steps>

This method is useful for developers testing the site or site owners who don't want to track their own visits.

Once disabled, the Rybbit script will not send any tracking data while preserving the API functions to prevent JavaScript errors.
